                <h1>ORDER OF CARMELITES (O. CARM)</h1>
                    <h2>The Origins</h2>
                    The Order of Carmelites has its origin on mount Carmel, in Palestine, where as we read in the 1 book of Kings, the great prophet Elijah defended the true faith in the God of Israel. From time immemorial, this mountain has been considered the lush garden of Palestine and symbol of fertility and beauty. Indeed ‘’ Karmel” means “garden”. In the XII century some penitent pilgrims who had come from Europe, came together near the “Spring of Elijah” in one of the narrow valley of mount Carmel, to live out their Christianity as hermits after the example of the prophet Elijah in the very land of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                      They lived a monastic life. In the middle of the cells(rooms) they built a chapel which they dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus, thus developing sense of belonging to our Lady as mistress of the place, and they become known by her name as “Brothers of our Lady of mount Carmel”. Thus, Carmel is deeply associated with Elijah and Mary. From Elijah the Carmelites inherited a burning passion for the living and true God. They are committed to live “in the footsteps of Jesus Christ” with the same intimate and deep feeling which were Mary’s.
                      Between 1206-1214, Albert Avogadro the patriarch of Jerusalem wrote for them a formula of life. Successive approvals of this formula of life by various popes helped the process of transforming the group into a religious Order; a fact that took place at the time of the definitive approval of the text as a Rule by Innocent IV IN 1247. Thus, the Carmelites Order took its place alongside the Mendicant Orders.	
                      The Carmelite Order Today
                      Carmelites are prompted “to live a life of allegiance to Jesus Christ and serve Him faithfully with a pure heart and a good conscience”. They found their allegiance to Christ in their commitment to seek the face of the living God in Prayer (contemplative life) and living in Fraternity and service in the midst of the people. And these three aspects of life forms the Carmelite Charism. They see all this in the lives of the prophet Elijah and Blessed Virgin Mary who were led by the Spirit of God. Looking at Mary and Elijah, it is easy for the Carmelites to understand, to interiorize, to live and to announce the truth that makes a person free.
                      Carmelites, conscious of being part of the Church and history, live in fraternity that is open to God 
                        and to people, able to listen and give an authentic response to the 
                        evangelical life according to their own Charism and they commit 
                        themselves to build the Kingdom of God wherever they are.
                    <h2>We Evangelize</h2>
                    We are committed to evangelize in houses of prayer, centers for spiritual exercises, parishes, Marian sanctuaries, schools, religious association, and to justice and peace, wherever human dignity is trodden underfoot, especially among the poor, the marginalized and the suffering.
                    Order of Carmelite (O.CARM) Family
                    Order of Carmelite family in the Church constitutes; Cloistered nuns, Congregation of sisters,
                    Lay missionary family, Secular Institute, communities of Hermits, Numerous groups of 
                    Third Order Lay Members and Confraternities of the Scapular of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel.<br/>

                    <h2>Charism of the Order</h2>
                    Charism is a gift from God to the Church for the world. The Charism of each religious family is the particular way in which its members are called to follow Christ. The charism of the Carmelites Order is God’s gift given originally to those nameless hermits who gathered on Mt, Carmel, beside the well of Elijah, at the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th centuries. Carmelite charism, first and most importantly, is a way of following Christ with total dedication. Carmelites do this by seeking to form contemplative communities at the service of God’s people in whose midst they live. Fraternity, service and contemplation are therefore essential values for all Carmelites.
                    Fraternity
                    <br/>Carmelites seek to form communities where each person feels accepted and valued not for what he can do but simple because he is. This kind of the community is in itself a witness that the love of God can break down the barriers which human beings set up and that it is possible for people of different backgrounds and nationalities to live in peace and harmony.
                    Service
                      <br/>Carmelites are called to serve the people of God in active apostolate. The Carmelite Order tries simply to respond to the needs of the Church and of the world which differ according to time and space and so many friars work in parishes, schools, universities, retreat centers, prisons, hospitals…
                    Contemplation
                      <br/>The heart of the Carmelites charism is prayer and contemplation. The quality 
                        of our prayer determines the quality of the community life and quality of the service,
                        which is offered to others. The goal of the Carmelite is 
                        union with God. We seek to live in God’s presence and consent 
                        to God’s will for us. This involves listening to God who speaks
                          to us in many ways especially in the words of the scripture. 
                          The ways of prayer is mysterious and goes beyond our normal 
                          human categories. Prayer opens us to the ultimate mystery.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

          <h1>Brief History</h1>
            <p>On a hill overlooking Nairobi stands a House of Prayer for all people - <strong>Nairobi Carmel </strong>- which was founded in 1940 by four Irish Nuns, Mother Teresa Dympna Leonard, Sister Therese Doyle, Sr. Bernadette O’Shaughnessy and Sr. Miriam Madden, from the Discalced Carmelite Monastery of the Incarnation in Hampton, Dublin, Ireland, at the invitation of Bishop Heffernan of the Vicariate of Zanzibar. 

                <br/><br/>The four ‘Pioneers’ travelled by Ship leaving from Tilbury Docks, London, England on October 24th 1938, feast of St. Raphael, Patron of Travellers. On board there were five Spiritan Priests so they had Mass and Communion for the duration of the long voyage.
                They arrived in Mombasa on November 23rd, Feast of the St. Columbanus, the great Irish Missionary Saint, and were welcomed by the Loreto Nuns and the ‘White Sisters’ - (Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa) and some Spiritan priests, but also the the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Riberi, who blessed and welcomed the four Carmelites into Kenya.
                
                <br/><br/>The next evening the four Nuns left for the long train journey to Nairobi. It was quite an experience for them to ‘climb’ from sea-level to 5,000 feet. On the journey they saw Zebra, Giraffes, Ostriches and Deer of various kinds. They were fascinated! At about 9.30 a.m, the train steamed into Nairobi Station and waiting to welcome the Carmelites, were Loreto Nuns and the Spiritan Superior of St. Austins Mission, (now St. Austin’s Parish), as well as other Spiritans. The Jacaranda trees were in bloom and the avenue was carpeted with mauve blossoms! The four Carmelites stayed at Loreto Convent, Msongari all the while that their Monastery was being built. The site they chose was on April 25th, as they processed up the hill carrying the Statue of the Infant of Prague, which we still have and treasure. In thanksgiving for the land, the Foundress, Mother Dympna requested that a procession be held each year in thanksgiving, on this day, a tradition which has been faithfully kept since then in Nairobi Carmel.
                
                <br/><br/>The Foundation Stone of the Monastery was laid by Bishop Joseph Shanahan, C.S.Sp the retired and famed Bishop of Southern Nigeria, on August 15th 1939. The retired Bishop had been invited to come to Nairobi by Bishop Heffernan and he became became the much revered and loved Chaplain of the Carmelites until his eath in 1944.
                Despite the many problems facing our Foundresses, as world War II was raging, thus making materials very difficult to procure, the Monastery was finished and on January 5th, Vigil of the Epiphany, 1940, the four Foundresses took possession of their Monastery of Mount Carmel, Nairobi ALLELUIA!!  The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was offered that morning as the first great act by Bishop Shanahan, in the absence of the Bishop Heffernan who was unable to come. There were present only the four Carmelites and the Loreto Sisters and one lay woman, a special friend. The Foundress wrote: “It was a wonderful half hour, Our Saviour coming down at the word of His saintly Missionary Bishop, to offer Himself on the little Altar His Carmelites had made ready, and then to take up His abode in the Tabernacle in this East African hillside, thence secretly to send the rays of His light out to hearts that are in need of Him.”
                
                <br/><br/>By four o’clock there was a large gathering in and around the Monastery. Bishop Shanahan spoke to the assembled people explaining what was about to take place. He spoke of the coming of the Magi and how they found the Divine Child with His Mother. He compared briefly the life of a Carmelite to Our Lady’s silence, her hidden life; its one object to reveal Jesus. He also explained that some are chosen by Him for one form of work, others for another, and the need of having some of us set apart who will pray and do penance for those who must live in the world. 
                The procession formed and every part of the Monastery was blessed by the Bishop. At the end, the four Carmelites knelt to receive the Bishop’s blessing at the Enclosure door. 
                The Bishop went out, locking the door behind him! Thus began the Carmelite life of strict enclosure!
                
                <br/><br/>In 1951, at the earnest appeal of His Grace, Archbishop John Joseph McCarthy of the Archdiocese of Nairobi, the Discalced Carmelites of Cleveland Carmel, Ohio, USA, generously sent six nuns from their Carmel to join the community in Nairobi. Three young women who came with the group, joined as Postulants, and the following year another young woman, sister to one of the three, and with us still, also entered as a Postulant. En route to Nairobi the group stopped in Dublin and visited the Monastery of the Incarnation (Hampton Carmel) which had sent the four Pioneer Nuns to Africa and spent a very happy day with the community. Then on to Lisieux, but as Mother Agnes, (Pauline,) St. Therese’s ‘Little Mother’ was dying, they did not see her, nor Sr. Genievieve, (Celine). But they assisted at Mass at the Altar behind which lies the waxen body of St. Therese. They also visited ‘Les Buisonnets’ and the Basilica. Onward to Rome where they joined a pilgrimage to Castel Gondolfo where they had the privilege of an audience with Pope Pius XII and talked to His Holiness.
                
                <br/><br/>When the Nuns from Cleveland arrived in Nairobi, they stayed at Loreto, Msongari, as Bishop McCarthy had requested some of the priests to show them around the Missions before they entered Carmel. Finally on the eve of the Feast of the Assumption, the Nuns arrived in Nairobi Carmel! What joy all around!! They sang the Magnificat and the Salve Regina. Everyone was convinced that it was Our Lady who brought them to Nairobi Carmel an answer to the prayers of the Foundresses!
                
                <br/><br/>Our first Kenyan joined in 1968 and subsequently many young Kenyan women joined, forming a vibrant healthy, happy, committed and integrated community.
                Our Foundresses and many of the community have since gone to God where we trust they are praying for us that Mother Dympna’s dream of a “House for all People” will continue to be realized and fulfilled. 
                
                <br/><br/>Our Carmel has indeed become a ‘House of Prayer for all people’, as many people of different faiths, and beliefs come to our Chapel to pray, or ring at the front door to ask for our prayers for their different intentions. We offer the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass once a month for all those who have asked for our prayers, and also Mass is offered once a month for our Families, Friends and Benefactors, each on different days.
                May our Holy Mother Teresa and all the Saints of Carmel continue to intercede for us and pray that we might always be true Carmelites and true Daughters of the Church!

                <h1>ST JOHN OF THE CROSS </h1>
                <h2>SECULAR ORDER OF DISCALCED CAMELITE GROUP:</h2> 
                <h3>LANGATA SOUTH ROAD NAIROBI KENYA</h3>
                
                <br/><br/><h2>Introduction</h2>
                St John of the Cross OCDS Group is a canonically established group of lay members from different parishes in Nairobi Machakos and Nakuru who attend the meeting every second Sunday of the month at the Discalced Carmelite Community Langata South Road under a Spiritual Director. 
                
                <h2>History</h2>
                In the last week of February 1993 Rev Sr Mary Elizabeth Angaine (OCD) a Nun of 
                Mt Carmel in Nairobi (now residing in the Savannah Community in Georgia USA) introduced the idea of forming a lay Carmelite group to one of the first members Maria Augusta Karanja (Deceased 2010). Maria Augusta took this information with a lot of interest. On the first Sunday of March 1993, she introduced the idea to Emma Murai who is now in definitive promises.
                Emma Murai introduced three other members as follows; <br/><br/>
                Josephine Michuki-		Deceased<br/>
                Immaculata Nyaga –		Definitive Promises<br/>
                Other members who joined later include<br/>
                Secuda Migui (Deceased)<br/>
                Mary Mwaniki (Deceased)<br/>
                
                
                <br/><br/>The first meeting was held on 7th March 1993 at the Carmelite Community Langata South Road Nairobi, for the first members, as an introductory meeting. This meeting was directed by Rev Fr Tom Martin OCD and this marked the beginning of the present Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites in Nairobi Kenya.
                The group fixed the time and days for future meetings to be every 2nd Sunday of the month between 2pm and 5pm. Later on the time of the meeting was changed to 9am to 2pm every second Sunday of the month.
                As this group was being formed in Langata, there was another group which had earlier been formed by a Consolata priest Rev Fr Demaria in the Consolata Parish Westlands. Some members from the Consolata Parish group joined the Langata Group and these members included Josephine Muthami, In Vows, who became the group’s first President and Josephine Karungu, In Vows who became the second President of the group.
                
                <h2>Members</h2>
                The group has grown in numbers from the original nine members to the present 
                membership of 19 who are in various stages of formation as follows;
                
                <h2>The Council</h2>
                Since the group’s formation elections have been held every three years with the last elections
                 being held virtually by Father Dennis Geng in October 2020. During elections members elect 
                 the following officers to the Council to run the matters of the community for three years;<br/>
                 <ul>
                     <li>President</li>
                     <li>Formations Director</li>
                     <li>Secretary/Treasurer to the Council</li>
                 </ul>
                	
                
                <h2>Monthly Meetings</h2>

                <h2>Activities</h2>>
                The group supports the Friars in prayers and small donations occasionally and especially during the Carmelite Feast Days. The group also gives tokens to friars during their ordinations. In addition the group takes care of the St Teresa of Avila and St John of the Cross Chapel at the Holy Family Basilica in Nairobi.
                Some of the members write articles on Carmelite spirituality for publication in their parish monthly magazine. One of the members attended the OCDS Conference in Boston USA held in August 2012 and October 2015 and was able to participate in the discussions on running an effective council.
                <h2>Milestones</h2>>
                Through the efforts of the Discalced Carmelite friars and one of our past president Bernadette Gitari a new group was formed at Our Lady of Sorrows Lioki Parish in the Archdiocese of Nairobi.
                We have ongoing discussions to introduce the Carmelite spirituality to the lay congregations at Tindinyo in Eldoret Diocese and Nyabururu in Kisii Diocese
                A brochure is in the process of being printed as part of our strategic plan of recruiting new 
                members and establishing new groups. <br/><br/>
